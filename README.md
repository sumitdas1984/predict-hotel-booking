# Predicting Hotel Bookings with User Search Parameters

Expedia is interested in predicting which hotel group a user is going to book. Expedia uses algorithms to form **hotel clusters**, where similar hotels are grouped together. These clusters are based on historical price, customer star ratings, geographical locations relative to city center, etc. These hotel clusters serve as good identifiers to which types of hotels people are going to book, while avoiding outliers such as new hotels that don't have historical data.

In this competition, the goal is to predict the booking outcome (hotel cluster) for a user event, based on their search and other attributes associated with that user event.

The general description and data are available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/expedia-hotel-recommendations).

I created this notebook for learning purposes and all credit's go to Susan Li and his [tutorial](https://towardsdatascience.com/predicting-hotel-bookings-with-user-search-parameters-8c570ab24805).
